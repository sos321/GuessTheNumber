# Guess the Number

This is my very first project created with JavaScript.
This project tought me basic JavaScript syntax and basic DOM manipulation.

This project was created while taking the [JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) from Jonas Schmedtmann.
Other notes and projects as well as the main repo for this course can be found [here](https://github.com/sos321/javascript-course).

Aim of this game is to guess the randomly generated number as fast as possible.
