# Guess the Number

This is my very first project created with JavaScript.
This project tought me basic JavaScript syntax and basic DOM manipulation.

This project was created while taking the [JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) from Jonas Schmedtmann.

Aim of this game is to guess the randomly generated number as fast as possible.
